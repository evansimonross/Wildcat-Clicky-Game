# Wildcat Clicky Hame
A memory game with a wildcat theme.

## How to Play
[Click here to play the game](https://evansimonross.github.io/Wildcat-Clicky-Game/).

All you have to do to play this game is start clicking!

Each round of the game, a certain number of wildcat images will be displayed. When you click one, the same images will be displayed in a shuffled order. Remember which ones you've clicked, because you lose the round if you click the same image twice!

If you manage to click all of the images once each, you win the round! The next level will have more images and will be a bigger challenge!

## Project History
This project was a homework assignment for the Columbia Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, testing our preliminary ability to use React JS. The idea of levels with increasing difficulties was not part of the project specifications, but I challenged myself by adding it in.
